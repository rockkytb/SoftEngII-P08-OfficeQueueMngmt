TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team P08)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done: 5 stories committed, 0 done
- Total points committed vs done: 19 points committed, 0 done 
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team): 56 hours planned, 10 hours (Filippo) + 9 hours (Rocco) + 9 ore (AleKrios) + 10 (Khatere) + 10 (Kricar) + 8 (Baldale) + 5 ore (Davide)

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

- Usable on the system

### Detailed statistics

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): Average = 2.8 hours. Standard deviation = 
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 3
  - Total hours spent: 0
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : N/A
  - Coverage (if available): N/A
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 3
  - Total hours spent : 0
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated : 4
  - Total hours spent : 3 (Filippo) + 2 (Rocco) + 2 ( AleKri ) + 3 (Kricar) + 2 (Baldale)
- Technical Debt management: N/A
  - Total hours estimated N/A
  - Total hours spent N/A
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube N/A
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues N/A
  - Hours spent on remediation N/A
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") N/A
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ) N/A
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  
  The reason is that we have never worked with Spring backend. Moreover, due to inexperience we have underestimated the stories and so we have commited a lot of stories in the  sprint.
   
  We tried to complete as many stories as possible rather than focusing on a single one.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
   We have learned a new framework for the backend (Spring). In a future project, we will able to work better with it.
   To better divide and assign the tasks. Basically, everyone selected the tasks he/she wanted without an assignment.
   

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  N/A, this is the first retrospective
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
   N/A, this is the first retrospective

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  We will focus on less stories per every sprint and we complete a story before starting another one.
  We will assign tasks in a better way
  We will discuss better about a problem
  We will try to do better estimation (avoid understimating stories).
  

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  
  We had no conflicts and we were all excited in learning a new framework instead of working in our comfort-zone.
